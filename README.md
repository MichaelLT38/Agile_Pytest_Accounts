This is a simple program of accounts to test using pytest. Pytest requires ctypes to access the functions for testing. They are mangled so you'll need to run "nm -j ./cmake-build-debug/account.so | grep _Z" to see those mangled function symbols. A batch script is provided for those on WIndows who have MSYS2 installed. The documentation is short because this is mostly for my own exploration of pytest. I'm just sharing it in case someone else wants to poke at it.
